    <h1> <em>Program Explanation</em> </h1> 
    <h2>Circle Radius</h2>

    <p>
        Below is the following program on how to find <br>
        the radius of a circle using code!
    </p>

    <p>
        int main()<br>
{<br>
	double pi = 3.14, circumference, <b>radius</b>, area; <br><br>

	cout << "Please enter the radius of the circle in inches: ";<br>
	cin >> <b>radius</b>;<br><br>

	circumference = 2 * pi * <b>radius</b> ;<br><br>

	area = pi * radius*radius;<br><br>

	cout << "\n\n";<br><br>

	cout << "Radius: " << <b>radius</b> << endl;<br><br>
	cout << "Circumference: " << circumference << endl;<br><br>
	cout << "Area: " << area << endl;<br><br>

    return 0;<br>
}
    </p>

    <p>
        The variable <b>radius</b> has been given the bold font to help point out its input <br>
        and its output at the end of the program. <br><br>

        You can see at the beginning of the code we are declaring the varible <b>radius</b> as double or float. <br>
        This is to allow the numbers to deal with decimals, example being 1.02. This is crucial to the program. <br>
        We will not consider <acronym> circle radius </acronym> as C.R. <br><br>

       It was once said in a book called Creating a Circle for the World <q><em>In order to find the area of a circle you must first be given the radius</em></q>. <br>
       In fact, the program asks the user to input a number to be the radius so that the program could do its calculations. <br><br>

       Now if I were run the program it would look like the following: <br><br>
      <b> Please enter the radius of the circle in inches: 10 <br><br>
        Radius: 10 <br>
        Circumference: 62.8 <br>
        Area: 314 </b><br><br>

        As you can see yo uare asked to give the C.R. then once the program does this calcu <br>
        lations you are given the C.R, the Circumference, and the Area of the cirlce. Isn't <br>
        Programming amazing!
