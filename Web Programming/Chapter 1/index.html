        I am starting my senior year this year! I've haven't had the best of years due to covid, but Tech has made the impact of the virus easy for me. <br>
        Currently I am the Vice President of ATUEsports, and have been competing for the school for about 3 years now. During the fall of 2020, the Overwatch team <br>
        made it to the top 32 out of 500 schools in the nation. I was lucky to be apart of that team!
